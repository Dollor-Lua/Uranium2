Welcome to the official repository of Uranium. Now, what is Uranium? Uranium is the 92nd element
on the period table with an atomic mass of 238.02891u. Haha, just kidding, Uranium is actually an
extensive text editor similar to `Atom.io` or `VSCode` written entirely in javascript, html, and css.

Uranium was written using [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron), and was based around all of your favorite
editors.

## Why Uranium

This project was originally made for the fun of myself. If you wish to use Uranium then don't expect the best out of it (and expect bugs). Not much else is there, though, so have fun with this.

## Contributing

You can submit bug reports or feature requests via the github issues.

If you'd like to write some code, you can also fork the repository, change or add some code, and make a pull request.

## Installing

Download the latest [Uranium Installer](https://github.com/Dollor-Lua/Uranium/releases).
Uranium will automatically update when a new release is available.

#### Other operating systems

Currently we will not support operating systems outside of MacOS, Linux, and Windows.
